<h1>Welcome to the adverntures of AirBnB clone</h1>
<h4>Background Context</h4>
<h6>Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!</h6>
Before starting, please read the AirBnB concept page.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:
<ul>
<li>put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances</li>
<li>create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file</li>
<li>create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel</li>
<li>create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.</li>
<li>create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine</li>
</ul>
<h4>What’s a command interpreter?</h4>
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
<ul>
<li>Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)</li>
<li>Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…</li>
<li>Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)</li>
<li>Update attributes of an object</li>
<li>Destroy an object</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>

<li>What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project</li>
<li>How to serialize and deserialize a Class</li>
<li>How to write and read a JSON file</li>
<li>How to manage datetime</li>
<li>What is an UUID</li>
<li>What is \*args and how to use it</li>
<li>What is \*\*kwargs and how to use it</li>
